Created an iOS 14 app that demonstrates the App Clip feature.With AppClips we can access some parts of the app without installing it on the device. More information can be found <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/app_clips" target="_blank" >here</a>

Learned the following:

1. Building an app using Swift UI.

2. Adding AppClip target and functionality to it.

3. Adding Dynamic Framework dependencies to it.

You can check out <a href="https://github.com/rajarahul12/iOSAppClips" target="_blank">the app code on GitHub</a>.
