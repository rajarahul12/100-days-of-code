Learned about MongoDB (A noSql database that stores data in the form of collections and documents)

But it is not a real-time database like firebase. We can use <a href="https://pusher.com/" target="_blank">Pusher</a> to make it real-time.

Implemented the following

1. Created a node server and intergrated it with MongoDB using Mongoose.
   (A client for MongoDB)

2. Added routes for fetching and adding data to MongoDB.

3. Integrated the server with React app.

4. Added <strong><i>Pusher</i></strong> both on front-end and back-end to get real-time functionality.
